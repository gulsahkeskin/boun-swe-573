## Project Description

A web application that enables users to search and tag scientific documents from [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) will be developed. 

Users will be able to search articles, view article title, abstract, authors and keywords; also tag the articles associated with Wikidata URLs like: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q178190.
